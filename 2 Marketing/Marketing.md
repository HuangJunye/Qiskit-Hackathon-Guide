# Marketing

After deciding the theme and participant mixture, you can use marketing channels to achieve the ideal mixture.

## Event page
Before you do marketing, you should the event page ready with necessary information about the hackathon:
- brief description
- date
- venue
- tentative schedule
- speakers and coaches

We recommend to use Eventbrite for hosting the event page, which is easy to use and it can also handle registration. [Here](https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/qiskit-hackathon-singapore-registration-72911980697) is an example Eventbrite page from Qiskit Hackathon @ Singapore.

You can also build an website for the event if you are confident with web design, but we don't think that is necessary. [Here](https://www.egr.msu.edu/qcbq/) is an example website from MSU-IBM Quantum Computing Bootcamp with Qiskit.
