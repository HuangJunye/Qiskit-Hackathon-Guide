# Marketing

After deciding the theme and participant mixture, you can use marketing channels to achieve the ideal mixture.

## Event page
Before you do marketing, you should the event page ready with necessary information about the hackathon:
- brief description
- date
- venue
- tentative schedule
- speakers and coaches

We recommend to use Eventbrite for hosting the event page, which is easy to use and it can also handle registration. [Here](https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/qiskit-hackathon-singapore-registration-72911980697) is an example Eventbrite page from Qiskit Hackathon @ Singapore.

You can also build an website for the event if you are confident with web design, but we don't think that is necessary. [Here](https://www.egr.msu.edu/qcbq/) is an example website from MSU-IBM Quantum Computing Bootcamp with Qiskit.

## Marketing channels

| Channels               | Examples                  | Content           |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| University departments | physics, computer science | poster, email     |
| Interest groups        | quantum, machine learning | email             |
| Social media           | Twitter, Facebook groups  | social media post |

You can find templates for poster, email and social media post under the `Marketing` folder.

## Registration

In general there are three different ways to select participants

| Methods           | Pros                             | Cons                                                                                           |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| invite-only       | high quality participants        | too exclusive, hard to achieve diversity, difficult to find enough participants for invitation |
| open registration | easy to find enough participants | not selective, difficult to ensure the quality of participants                                 |
| screening         | selectivity                      | time-consuming and difficult to do screening                                                   |

Suggestion: a hybrid method:
1. invite 30% participants
1. target ideal mixture via marketing
1. open registration to fill remaining spots

We recommend to use Eventbrite to handle registration. You can create a private page for invite-only events at the beginning and switch it to public for open registration later on.

You can also use online survey tools to handle registration such as AirTable and Google Forms.
