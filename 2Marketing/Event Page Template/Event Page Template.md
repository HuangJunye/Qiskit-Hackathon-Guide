## Introduction
Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionise fields such as materials research, drug discovery and finance. Though the research and technology still has a long way to go, research groups and industry players are already exploring possible quantum algorithms for applications. Here is your chance to learn about the latest developments in quantum computing and code programs for quantum computers.

The hackathon is open to students and professionals from all fields (spoiler - you don’t need to be a quantum physicist to program a quantum computer!). Prior knowledge in programming with Python is expected and participants will need to bring their own laptops for coding. The event is free to attend and there will be arrangements for meals and refreshments. Shortlisted applicants will be informed via email and further instructions on how to prepare for the hackathon will be provided.

Come join us for 2 days of fun-filled tutorials and hacking using the Qiskit tool- an open source quantum computing software development framework for quantum programming.

Deadline to register - 4th October 2019 (Friday)- [Registration closed due to overwhelming response]
