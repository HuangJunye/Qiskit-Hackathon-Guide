Hi Qiskitters,

The hackathon is just one day away! We are so excited to meet you!

This is a gentle reminder for the hackathon. Please come to `venue` at `start time` for registration. (Getting to `venue`: `link to directions to the venue` )

Please bring your own laptop with Python and Qiskit installed. Refer to the previous confirmation email sent for details about installation and learning resources about Qiskit or check out the quick guide [here](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html#install).

Looking forward to hosting you all for two days of fun-filled quantum programming.

Keep calm and hack on.
