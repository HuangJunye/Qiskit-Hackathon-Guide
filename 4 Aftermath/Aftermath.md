# What to do after hackathon

Here we suggest a few things to do to after the event to improve the overall experience of the hackathon.

## Collect feedback
Do a post-event survey to collect feedback to know where you did well and where you didn't. The survey results will be very useful for future Qiskit hackathon organizers. You can the post-event survey template in the `Aftermath` folder.

## Networking party
We suggest to organize a dinner and networking party right after the hackathon finishes. After seeing each other and working together for 2 days, this is when the real bonding between people are formed! Bring the booze and turn on the music!

## Complete project information
Don't forget to ask participants to complete project information on their Github repositories. These information will be very important for potential collaborators in the future. Try to get it done within two weeks after the hackathon.

## Write a recap article
After taking some well-deserved rest, you should gather some photos and thoughts to write a recap article to describe what an amazing weekend you just had. You can write about the history of the event, how it was initiated, how you got to finally organizing the event, what went well and what didn't go so well, what people built, etc.

Strike while the iron is hot! Try to get it done within one week after the hackathon. Share it on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. You deserve a lot of the likes!

## Follow up meeting a few weeks later
You can organize an online followup meeting a few weeks after the hackathon to discuss the plans for continued development of projects. This is not a compulsory meeting. Only interested participants need to participant.

## Continue developing projects
Rome wasn't built in a day. Whatever was developed during the hackathon won't be great if there is no continued development afterwards. Here are some motivating examples.

### QPong
QPong is a quantum version of the classic video game Pong made in Qiskit Camp 2019. The hackathon version was very buggy and barely playable. But after further development for only a week in April (one month after the Qiskit Camp), it was good enough for a demo in [Boston Museum of Science](https://twitter.com/JavaFXpert/status/1114626404778426370?s=20) and being featured in the first ever episode of [Coding with Qiskit Youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1NZC5rqQD8).

Afterwards, the game was [rewritten in Unity C#](https://github.com/HuangJunye/QPong-Unity) for the IBM Quantum Arcade machine.

### QizGloria
QizGloriz is the winning project of Qiskit Camp Europe 2019. It is a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning interface with full Qiskit and PyTorch capabilities. This project will soon be [incorporated into Qiskit](https://medium.com/qiskit/project-highlight-hybrid-quantum-classical-machine-learning-e5319982e3b1).
