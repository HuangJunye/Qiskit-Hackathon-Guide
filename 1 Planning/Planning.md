# Planning

## What do you need?

Organizing a hackathon can seem very overwhelming. You will need many things:

- organizing team, to plan and run the event
- participants, to attend the event
- speakers, to conduct workshops
- coaches, to help participants during hacking sessions
- judges, to decide winning teams
- venue, to host the event
- food, for participants
- funding, to pay for the cost of venue, food and other expenses

But don't be afraid. This guide is here to help you settle everything for a successful hackathon!

## How to get started?

### Find a team
The best advice we can give you to start planning a Qiskit Hackathon is: find an organizing team. You should look for at least one person, who is equally passionate about quantum computing as yourself to form an organizing team. Having a group to rely on, delegate work to, and bounce ideas between becomes invaluable once you get into the nitty gritty details.

### Talk to Qiskit
After forming an organizing team, you can start a conversation with Qiskit (email: hello@qiskit.camp) to express your interest to organize a local Qiskit Hackathon. Qiskit community team will give you advice on how to proceed forward.

### Talk to University
At the same time, you can start a conversation with relevant student club, department or institute (quantum computing association, quantum center, department of physics, chemistry or computer science) in your university about hosting the potential Qiskit Hackathon. Ask for their support: venue, funding and logistics, etc.

From here, you can link up Qiskit community team and the University to kickstart the official discussion!

## Ideal timeline
| Time  | Agenda                                               |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------|
| T-14W | Find a team                                          |
| T-12W | Contact Qiskit & University for discussion (4 weeks) |
| T-8W  | Discussion of legal agreement (2 weeks)              |
|       | After signing legal agreement, the date is clear. The date should be 4-6 weeks after signing legal agreement.                                       |
| T-6W  | Marketing planning (2 weeks)                         |
| T-4W  | Marketing (2 weeks)                                  |
| T-2W  | Select participants (1 week)                         |
| T-1W  | Confirmation of participants                         |

Suggestion: start contact at least 3 months in advance.

## Branding
Event name: Qiskit Hackathon @ (City or University)
Example: Qiskit Hackathon @ SG

## Topics

- quantum games
- quantum machine learning
- quantum chemistry
- quantum algorithms
- quantum applications

### Organising Committee
roles
- logistics (food, venue)
- marketing (communication)
- social media (photography, twitter, facebook, medium)

Social Media
Hashtag: #qiskithackathon + university/city or just #qiskithackathon
Example #qiskithackathonsg for Qiskit Hackathon @ Singapore

### Legal Agreement
you need sign legal agreement with qiskit in order to receive swag and prizes provided by qiskit.

## Participants
The first thing you need to decide is the number of participants. In the university level, 20-50 people is a reasonable size. You can think in terms of number of teams. A team consist of 3-5 people, with 4 people on average. Example, 40 people means about 10 teams. You should also take into account that there will always 10-20% people decide not to go in the last minute.

From past hackathons, we found out a diverse participants pool produce meaningful interactions and learning. There are the backgrounds of usual qiskit hackathon participants: physicists, chemists, artists, software developer, game developer, tech enthusiasts.

How to select participants?
1. first come first serve
1. select based on background

Tools: AirTable or Google Forms
