# Running the hackathon

## Before the event
Here is a list of things you should get ready before the actual event, which will be covered in this page.
- Fix the schedule
- Plan pre-hackathon events
- Plan tutorials / workshops
- Look for volunteers to run the hackathon (>4): MC, technical support, logistics, social media
- create a dedicated channel on Qiskit Slack workspace
   - contact Leron Gil on Slack for assistance
- Create a github repository for hosting the ideas/projects
- Choose a platform for team formation

## Pre-hackathon events
Based on previous Qiskit hackathons, pre-hackathon events can significantly improve overall hackathon experience for participants. These are (optional) pre-hackathon events that you can consider.

- Share learning resources with participants
   - [Qiskit for Educators](https://community.qiskit.org/education/)
     - [Coding with Qiskit Youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY)
     - [Qiskit textbook](https://community.qiskit.org/textbook/)
     - [Qiskit tutorials](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-iqx-tutorials)
   - [IBM Q experience](https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/technology/experience/)
- Online interactions via Slack
   - self-introductions
   - brainstorming
- Workshops
   - introduction to quantum computing
   - Qiskit basics
   - quantum games
   - quantum machine learning
   - quantum algorithms
- Networking party

## Tutorials & workshops
There should be tutorials/workshops on Day 1 morning to prepare all participants for the hackathon (if these topics haven't been covered in pre-hackathon events).

Suggested sessions:
- Quantum computing 101 (30 min)
- Qiskit basics (1h)
   - terra, IBM Q Experience
- Qiskit applications (1h)
   - aqua, QML, chemistry, games (focus on one topic)

These workshops should more hands-on to let participants learn by doing. Make sure workshops stay on schedule.

## Team formation
You should encourage participants to post their ideas before the hackathon or during the hackathon before the pitching session. During the pitching session, each person has only 1 min to explain the idea and what kind of people/expertise they are looking for. You can post ideas/teams on one of these websites: 1) hackathon.io, 2) crowdforge.io, 3) Github.

After pitching, team leaders should be assigned a number and some space in the event venue so that interested participants can approach them to get to know more about the ideas. The team formation process should be less than one hour. Organizers should go around to make sure that everybody gets a team and no team has more than 5 people. Help participants who could not find teams to get a team and team them up to form a new team and assign them an idea.

Assign each team with a coach. Coach helps team to consolidate their ideas and point them to directions or resources to check when they face problems. To maximize participant's experience, a coach should only be assigned to 2 teams on average.

## Hacking

During hacking sessions, coaches should check their teams' progress regularly. Organizers should also go around to that all the teams are going smoothly and if they need anything. Alert everyone 1 hr before Science Fair and Final Pitching to get prepared.

## Judging

### Judging criteria
Here are the judging criteria from the official Qiskit hackathon guide. All Qiskit hackathons should follow the same judging criteria.
- Originality and Uniqueness (25%)
  - Compared to what you've seen before, how unique is this project? How much does
it challenge the assumptions of classical computing? How interesting do you find
it?
- Usefulness and Complexity (25%)
  - Will other people be able to use this project? Was the project thoughtful in how it was designed? Can you picture yourself helping build this code further?
  - Quantum Community Benefit (25%)
  - Will this project help the community at large? Will this project spark interest and
get others involved in quantum? Will this project help others learn and understand
quantum computing?
- Presentation & Science Fair (25%)
  - Did the team represent their project well? Did the entire team get a chance to speak? During the science fair, were they able to explain what they did?

### Judging sessions
We suggest to have two kinds of judging sessions: 1) science fair and 2) elevator pitch. Elevator pitch (3 min) is a short and concise present/demo to showcase the core idea or feature of the projects done in the hackathon in front of all judges and participants. In science fair, judges go around to check each team. Details and technicalities of projects can be explained in greater depth during science fair to let judges appreciate the projects better while saving other participants time during the pitching.

After the judging sessions, judges should have a close door discussion to decide the winners. You can also include an optional community choice award for participants to vote for their favorite project.

## Prizes and Awards
All participants will have swag provided by Qiskit. We strongly recommend to get the university to print out participation certificate for all participants. Top 3 prizes are provided by Qiskit.
