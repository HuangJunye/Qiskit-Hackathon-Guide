# Planning

## What do you need?

Organizing a hackathon can seem very overwhelming. You will need many things:

- organizing team, to plan and run the event
- participants, to attend the event
- speakers, to conduct workshops
- coaches, to help participants during hacking sessions
- judges, to decide winning teams
- venue, to host the event
- food, for participants
- funding, to pay for the cost of venue, food and other expenses

But don't be afraid. This guide is here to help you settle everything for a successful hackathon!

## How to get started?

### Find a team
The best advice we can give you to start planning a Qiskit Hackathon is: find an organizing team. You should look for at least one person, who is equally passionate about quantum computing as yourself to form an organizing team. Having a group to rely on, delegate work to, and bounce ideas between becomes invaluable once you get into the nitty gritty details.

### Talk to Qiskit
After forming an organizing team, you can start a conversation with Qiskit (email: hello@qiskit.camp) to express your interest to organize a local Qiskit Hackathon. Qiskit community team will give you advice on how to proceed forward.

### Talk to University
At the same time, you can start a conversation with relevant student club, department or institute (quantum computing association, quantum center, department of physics, chemistry or computer science) in your university about hosting the potential Qiskit Hackathon. Ask for their support: venue, funding and logistics, etc.

From here, you can link up Qiskit community team and the University to kickstart the official discussion!

### Ideal timeline
| Time  | Agenda                                               |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------|
| T-14W | Find a team                                          |
| T-12W | Contact Qiskit & University for discussion (4 weeks) |
| T-8W  | Discussion of legal agreement (2 weeks)              |
| T-6W  | Marketing planning (2 weeks)                         |
| T-4W  | Marketing (2 weeks)                                  |
| T-2W  | Select participants (1 week)                         |
| T-1W  | Confirmation of participants                         |

After signing legal agreement, the date is more clear. The date should be 4-6 weeks after signing legal agreement.  

Suggestion: start contact at least 3 months in advance and plan ahead to account for unexpected delays!

## Theme
Good hackathons usually have a theme. If this is one of the first quantum hackathons in your city, the them can just be "quantum". You can also choose to focus on one of these topics:
- quantum games
- quantum machine learning
- quantum chemistry
- quantum algorithms
- quantum applications

## Participants
### Number of participant
One of the first thing you need to decide in the planning is the target number of participants. In the university level, 20-50 people is a reasonable size. You can think in terms of number of teams. For Qiskit Hackathons, a team consists of 3-5 people, with 4 people on average. For examples, 40 participants mean about 10 teams. You should also take into account that there will always be 20 to 30% people deciding not to turn up at the end.

There are many factors you need to consider to determine the number of participants: size of the venue, number of coaches, time in the schedule for idea pitching and final pitching, budget for booking the venue and ordering food.

Suggestion: keep the hackathon small and sweet. A rule of thumb: number of participant < 8 * number of coaches. That is based on the fact that each coach can only help two teams on average to maximize the experience of participants. If you can't find enough of coaches, keep the number of particiapnts small.

### Participant mixture
If the hackathon is themed, you should invite or target the participant mixture accordingly. In general, from past hackathons experience, we found that a diverse participants pool produces meaningful interactions and learning. These are the backgrounds of usual qiskit hackathon participants:
- scientists: physicists, chemists, biologists, engineers
- developers: software, game, web, etc.
- designers: art, UI/UX
- domain experts: finance, machine learning, chemists, etc.
